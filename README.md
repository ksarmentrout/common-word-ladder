# Common Word Ladder

This is a creative writing tool based on Jeff Tweedy's "Word Ladder" exercise from his book [How to Write One Song](https://wilcostore.com/products/jeff-tweedy-how-to-write-one-song-book'). The word ladder is meant to connect words that aren't typically seen or used together in order to spark inspiration for lyrics or other writing. 

Elsewhere in the book, he advocates for using simple language. This tool 
combines those ideas into a word pair generator that draws from the most common 
words in English.

Select the sources you'd like to pull from for each of the two words using the dropdowns and then hit "Generate" to produce a new unique pair. Hopefully these pairings can serve as the basis of some new songs! 

The common words were sourced from the lists [here](https://wikilangs.wordpress.com/2013/08/24/top-2000-common-words-in-english/). "Ladder" icon is by Lars Meiertoberens from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/ladder) (CC BY 3.0).
